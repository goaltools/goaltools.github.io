						Code Generation
					</span>
					<p>
						Goal Tools rely on the concept of code generation rather than runtime reflection.
						As a result <strong>better type safety</strong> and <strong>productivity
						of the end developer</strong> are provided.
						Catch errors when you are building not running your app.
						And focus on things that matter, Goal will take care of the rest.

						Customizability
					</span>
					<p>
						Components of Goal Tools are built with <strong>compatibility with the standard library</strong>
						in mind.
						Moreover they are <strong>loosely coupled</strong> and thus can be easily replaced with
						alternative implementations.
						The result is you can use your own router, template system, reverse routes generator
						or any other component.
